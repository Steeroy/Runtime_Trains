# Navigation Bar, Footer and Rendered Tickets

## We have done the following

1. Made the navigation and footer responsive for the breakpoints: 992px, 768px and 480px

2. We have added Helmet to our website to ensure the title of each page is unique

3. We have created a data file that has the data used by the trains

4. We have rendered the information in the train data file so we can view available trains

## What's next?

1. Get these products from backend
2. Built cart items
3. Keep state of the website using redux so we can finish the checkout part
4. Render the correct available trains
